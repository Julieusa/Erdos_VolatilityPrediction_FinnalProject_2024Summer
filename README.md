# Short Term Volatility Prediction For Stocks
This project contains the final project of May-Summer 2024 Data Science Boot Camp

# Overview
This project aims to build an efficient model to predict short-term volatility for hundreds of stocks across different sectors. It is based on the Kaggle competition-Optiver Realized Volatility Prediction. Volatility studies are extremely useful for short-term trading and intraday derivatives trading. Scalpers and day traders use volatility to trade in options, as both option buyers and writers expect high volatility for better returns over time.

# Dataset
The dataset is provided by Optiver in Kaggle competition in folder **optiver-realized-volatility-prediction**
- Order book data, Trade book data, train and test csv files
- No data cleanning is needed
- The total number of different stocks is 112
- The total number of different time\_id is 3830
# Exploratory Data Analysis
# Modeling Approach
Model perfomance is evaluated by root mean square percentage error 
$$ RMSPE = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((y_i - \hat{y}_i)/y_i)^2}$$
